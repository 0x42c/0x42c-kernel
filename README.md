0x42c-kernel is a standalone multithreaded kernel for DCPU-16, which forms the basis for 0x42c.

## Building from Source

Clone the repository and run the appropriate script in build/

Mono is required on Linux and Mac.

## Implementing

Presently, you are not able to use 0x42c-kernel realisticly in your projects. Please await official
disk drive specifications from Notch, at which point 0x42c-kernel will support loading an operating
system from disk and an implementation guide will be written.
